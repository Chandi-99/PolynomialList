# PolynomialList
a linked list to store a polynomial that is every node of the linked list has coefficient, exponent, and pointers to the next node in the list.
Consider a linked list to store a polynomial that is every node of the linked list has
coefficient, exponent, and pointers to the next node in the list. The function should accept
pointers to the two polynomials as arguments and return the pointer to the resultant
polynomial. Assume that the polynomials passed to the function are in decreasing order on
the exponents.
Example:
7x 80 + 5x 50 + 3x 30 + 1 = 0
9x 90 + 6x 60 + 2x 30 + 3 = 0
